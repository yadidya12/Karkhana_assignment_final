Write a Python script that models a Mobius strip using parametric equations and computes key geometric properties.

Requirements Define a MobiusStrip class that: Accepts: Radius R (distance from the center to the strip) Width w (strip width) Resolution n (number of points in the mesh) Computes: A 3D mesh/grid of (x, y, z) points on the surface Surface area (numerically, using integration or approximation) Edge length (numerically along the boundary)
Parametric Equation of Mobius Strip Use the parametric equations: x(u,v)=(R+v⋅cos⁡(u2))⋅cos⁡(u) y(u,v)=(R+v⋅cos⁡(u2))⋅sin⁡(u) z(u,v)=v⋅sin⁡(u2) Where: u∈[0,2π] v∈[−w/2,w/2]
Deliverables Python script (clean, modular, commented). 3D plot or screenshot (if you include visualization). A short write-up explaining: How you structured the code How you approximated surface area Any challenges you faced This assignment tests: Parametric 3D modeling Numerical integration / geometry Visualization Code clarity

Code Explanation:
- The MobiusStrip class encapsulates all functionality needed to model the strip.
- The parametric equations define the shape using u and v parameters.
- Mesh generation uses numpy.meshgrid() to discretize the surface.
- Surface area is approximated via numerical integration of the normal magnitude.
- The edge length is computed analytically.
